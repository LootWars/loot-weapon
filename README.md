# Loot Weapons

__Looters! Come and collect your arms! War is upon us, we must fight!__

The Weaponsmith is open. Looters will be able to mint their weapons and reveal their underlying powers.

Claim the weapon from your lootbag and reveal your stats: attack, defense, durability, weight and magic.

# Claiming

Here's how you can claim your loot weapons:

* Open https://etherscan.io/address/0x0ac0ecc6d249f1383c5c7c2ff4941bd56decdd14#writeContract

* Click Connect to web3.

* To mint with existing loot, click "claimForLoot" and enter your loot ID less than 8000.

* To mint without loot, click "claim" and enter an ID greater than 8000, but less than 9575.

* If that loot weapon has already been claimed, metamask will show a very high cost for gas.



__PREPARE FOR WAR!__
